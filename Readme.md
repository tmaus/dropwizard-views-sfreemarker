# Dropwizard Freemarker View for Scala
Wraps Scala objects/properties into Freemarker ones. 
 
## Version 
0.1 Very rudimentary version, mainly hacked together to suit my current needs. 
Tests and proper code polishing will follow as soon as someone is interested in it. 
  
 
## Installation
At this point in time, no bundle has been pushed onto a public repository. 
You will thus have to install it into your local repository. 
  Pls. check the 'build.gradle' for details. 

## Credits
The credits for this project mainly go to the authors of these two git repositories:
